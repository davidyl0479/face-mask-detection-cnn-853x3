# Face Mask Detection CNN Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face mask detection using a dataset of 853 images across 3 classes from Kaggle's "Face Mask Detection" dataset.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle - Face Mask Detection dataset by Andrew MV
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
- **Total Images**: 853
- **Classes**: 3 (with_mask, without_mask, mask_weared_incorrect)
- **Format**: Images with XML annotations (PASCAL VOC format)
- **Task**: Multi-class image classification
- **Download**: Use Kaggle API or manual download from the link above

## Project Goals
- Build and train a CNN model for face mask detection
- Achieve high accuracy on the 3-class classification task
- Implement proper data preprocessing and augmentation
- Evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics
- Create a pipeline for inference on new images

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Data Processing**: OpenCV, PIL, or similar for image handling
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, seaborn for plots and analysis
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

## Development Steps
1. Download and explore the Kaggle dataset
2. Implement data preprocessing and augmentation
3. Design CNN architecture suitable for the task
4. Train the model with proper validation split
5. Evaluate performance and tune hyperparameters
6. Create inference pipeline for new images
7. Document results and create visualizations

## Key Considerations
- Handle class imbalance if present in the dataset
- Implement proper train/validation/test splits
- Use appropriate data augmentation techniques
- Consider transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Monitor for overfitting during training

## Expected Deliverables
- Clean, well-documented Python code
- Trained model with saved weights
- Performance evaluation report
- Inference script for new images
- Data visualization and analysis plots
